Create a basic app for keeping track of an inventory of things. The app should at minimum allow the user to do the following things: 1. Keep track of at least one product. Let's start with bananas. 2. Manage the quantities of the product(s). There should be a way to increase and decrease the number of items of the product(s) in the inventory. 3. Send an email if the quantity of a product hits zero.
